# Simon Game

A web-based Simon game that tests your memory by repeating sequences of colors. The game starts on keypress, with each correct sequence advancing the level. Built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, it features intuitive gameplay and visual feedback. The game ends on a mistake, allowing you to restart and try again.

## Features

- **Memory Challenge:** The game challenges your memory by requiring you to repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors.
- **Level Progression:** Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, you advance to the next level, where a new color is added.
- **Intuitive Gameplay:** The game is easy to understand and play, making it accessible to all ages.
- **Visual Feedback:** Colors light up and sound effects play, providing clear feedback for each step in the sequence.
- **Restart on Mistake:** If you make a mistake, the game ends, but you can restart and try again with a simple keypress.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling for the game interface, including animations and responsive design.
- **jQuery:** Handles the game logic, user interactions, and animations.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** The game begins when you press any key on your keyboard.
2. **Watch the Sequence:** A sequence of colors will flash on the screen. Pay attention to the order.
3. **Repeat the Sequence:** Use your mouse or touch to repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. **Advance Levels:** If you repeat the sequence correctly, you move on to the next level with a longer sequence.
5. **Make a Mistake:** If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and you can press a key to restart and try again.
